## Student Management System for Python

# A fully functional project which handles student data including name, ID, and grades. 

This Python project stores student-related information to a text file when the program is exited. This data is read and displayed each time the program runs. Data from previous  executions can be modified or deleted at any point.

Program settings can also be modified to determine whether student ID values allow characters, the maximum length of the ID, and the choice between 'E' or 'F' failing grade notation.
