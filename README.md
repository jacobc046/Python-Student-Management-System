## Student Management System for Python

# A fully functional project which handles student data including name, ID, and grades. Data is preserved among program termination and is modifiable when ran again. 

This Python project stores student-related information and stores the data into a txt file when program is exited. This data is read and displayed each time the program runs. Data from previous program executions can be modified or deleted. 

Program settings can also be modified to determine whether student ID values allow characters, the maximum length of the ID, and the choice between 'E' or 'F' failing grade notation.
